# minecraft-player-count-js
This project is a Discord bot that monitors the status of a Minecraft server. It periodically fetches the player count from the server using the mcstatus.io API and updates the bot's activity accordingly. The bot displays the number of online players as its status, or "Server Offline" if the server is not reachable.
